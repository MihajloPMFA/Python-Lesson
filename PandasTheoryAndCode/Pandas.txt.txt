As we previously stated before, the Pandas library is used for reading,writing and manipulating DataFrames.

1. First open the "Neccessary Data and Chart Example" folder, and inside it, the "dataset.csv" file.
		You will find that the file is fairly hard to read. That is the main reason why we have imported the Pandas library.

2. Open the "PandasReadingCSV.py" file inside Vs Code and go through it.

3. After reading the csv file, and converting it into a DataFrame, open the 'example.png' file.
		On the x - axis you will see 4 specific gaming platforms in this order: PS4, XOne, PC ans WiiU.
		Because we have many more consoles in the DataFrame we will have to filter out the unneccesary consoles.
		Open the "DataFrameFilter.py" file in the "PandasTheoryAndCode" folder in VS Code.

4. Now that we have successfully filtered out the DataFrame, we only have a couple of steps left before we can start plotting the chart.
		Open the "DataFrameGrouping.py" file in the "PandasTheoryAndCode" folder in VS Code.

Congradulations, if you got this far it means that you are done setting up the data we need, and are ready to begin plotting the chart.
You can close this file and folder, and return to the "ProjectSetup.txt" file.
