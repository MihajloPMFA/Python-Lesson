For this particular chart we will be utilizing 2 libraries:
	- Matplotlib
	- Pandas

The Matplotlib library is the library that contains the neccessary functions for data visualization.
The Pandas library is used for reading/writing and manipulating DataFrames.

When importing a library in Python we use the import function and after it we write the name of the library.
Feel free to open the "ImportingLibraries.py" example file in Vs Code.

After going through the example file, you can continue to the next step in the "Project SetUp.txt" file.
